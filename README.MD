# Introduction

This is a simple code snippet on how to understand and implement concurrency in Python using the asyncio module.
I hope this example could be used as a refresher for developers like me who don't get into concurrency stories very often.

Please check the async.py comments to be guided through the concepts and behaviors expected to be implemented when creating concurrent systems.

This is not an exaustive guide and additions may be included for clarity or to detail concepts.

Thanks
